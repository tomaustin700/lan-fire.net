        A bios string is a collection of numbers and letters stored in every motherboards bios chip looking something like this "06/10/2004-VT8377/VT8235-A7V8X-X" the first part of the string shows the bios release date. the middle part identified it as using the kt400 chipset and the last part shows it's model number. Using this data it would not be hard to find drivers for this board (Asus A7v8x-x)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>How do I find my boards bios string?</strong><br>
        Simply download this program <a href="Files/Octools/bwz-rel.exe">HERE</a> called Bios wizard, among other things it gives your bios string. Alternatively if you look at your pc screen when it first boots the bios string will be displayed in the top right hand corner of the post screen, but it flashed by too quick to read on most pcs! (the program can be found in the downloads section)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Program downloaded what now?</strong><br>
        Well click the RUN button when the program has finished loading and it will run a few tests to find the capabilities of your board and then, when these have finished you should have a screen like this, I have labeled were the bios string on the picture:<br>

        <br>
        <strong>Ok got the bios string now what?</strong><br>
        Copy the bios string into google and click on one of the sites that will help you identify it. One last note though some bios's have invalid bios strings meaning they will not put correct results into one of these string search engines. This usually happens with old pc-chips boards and engineering samples.</font></td>
