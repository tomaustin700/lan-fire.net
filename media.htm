Many of you will be familiar with a new bread of PC promoted by intell and Microsoft called the HTPC or home theater PC.  These computers have been around for 4 years or more but have only recently become popular with the launch of windows xp media center addition.  This is windows xp in a new shell which is easy to read on a TV screen from a distance and navigate with a remote control.  With windows media center edition manufactures have had an incentive to start to pre package Pc's with HTPC functionality.  The main problem to this is that media center is not available to by except with a new computer from a major supplier, an expensive proposition at best, thus the purpose of this guide is to educate you in how to build a HTTPC
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>What constitutes a HTPC?</strong><br>
A HTPC is a computer capable of capturing live video and audio streams and storing them or redistributing them on a medium such as DVD-RW.  Many HTPC's have electronic program guides similar to the ones with freeveiw and sky making them subtable for replacing the TV times lost behind the sofa.

<br>
<strong>
What hardware does a HTPC contain?<br>
</strong>
Normal Pc components (ram,mobo,.ECT)
<br>
Some kind of motion picture capture card/ tuner
<br> 
A remote control device Eg. TV wonder (don't want to be getting up all the time do you?)
<br>
Large capacity hard disk(s) ( video files are huge!)
<br>
Relevant software
<br>
<br>
<br>
As you can see HTPC's are normal computers with a few add aditional components so an existing PC could be converted or one could be built from scratch.  Building from scratch is the more common option as many people object to a big beige tower next to there TV! Because of this SFF (small form factor) computers have become widespread.  A small form factor computer is anything bellow standard ATX size (micro ATX, shuttles .ext)

<strong>
My HTPC project:
</strong>
<br>
I am using the following components in my HTPC build:<br>
1.2800+ athlon (barton core)<br>
2.shuttle SN45G SFF chaises<br>
3.5900xt graphics card<br>
4.512mb crucial cas=3 memory<br>
5.80Gb Maxtor hard disk (will be upgraded with an additional 200gb HD when cash is available)<br>
6.All in wonder remote or simlar <br>
7.Some kind of TV capture card <br>
<br>
<br>
Im sure this project will enthrall you as it comes to life! In the next installment I will show photographs of the hardware I have already got for this project.  THe picture I have created bellow is to demonstrate the idea that the media pc becomes the center of your "digital" experience...
